/// Internal error type for mutation path building that preserves semantic information.
///
/// This enum replaces the `MutationResult` type alias to properly handle both expected
/// mutation limitations (`NotMutableReason`) and actual system errors. The `BuilderError`
/// flows through all internal functions without conversion. Only at the module's public
/// interface in `recurse_mutation_paths()` do we convert `BuilderError` appropriately:
/// - `NotMutable` variants become success with `NotMutable` status
/// - `System` variants propagate as errors
///
/// This design ensures that semantic information about why types cannot be mutated
/// is preserved throughout the internal processing and properly communicated to users.
