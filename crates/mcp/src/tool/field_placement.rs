//! Traits for field placement system
//!
//! These traits work with the `FieldPlacement` derive macro to provide:
//! - Field placement information
//! - Direct field access without JSON serialization
//! - Automatic `CallInfo` generation

/// Specifies where a response field should be placed in the output JSON
#[derive(Clone, Debug)]
pub enum FieldPlacement {
    /// Place field in the metadata object
    Metadata,
    /// Place field in the result object
    Result,
    /// Place field in the `error_info` object
    ErrorInfo,
}

/// Whether to omit a `None`-valued field from the serialized output.
#[derive(Clone, Copy, Debug, PartialEq, Eq)]
pub enum SkipIfNone {
    Omit,
    Keep,
}

impl From<bool> for SkipIfNone {
    fn from(value: bool) -> Self {
        if value { Self::Omit } else { Self::Keep }
    }
}

/// Information about where a field should be placed in the response
///
/// Note: The `ParamStruct` and `ResultStruct` derive macros generate implementations that use
/// `crate::tool::FieldPlacementInfo` and `crate::tool::HasFieldPlacement`
